ive created an application to convert publisher files to pdf as certain windows 11 devices and office 2024 packages are losing support for publisher and need files converted.

this is to be run before upgraded as publisher is requiered to be on the computer (or have access to your files and a different computer with publisher)


instructions
-
the user must select a folder/directory containing the .pubs to convert, they will not be visable when picking the folder
once selected a list of the publisher files found in that directory and sub directory will be displayed to confirm they are correct

once done the user can select the convert button and a ✅ for successful conversions and an ❌ for insuccessful
code meanings
-
there are 3 colours a file becomes if converted/not converted
    
-green, successful first try
    
-orange, failed 1 or 2 times but successful
    
-red, unsuccessful and the file could not convert

when it is the last option instead of a message saying "all files converted successfully" it will instead say "most files converted successfully [a list of file directories for the failed ones]"
